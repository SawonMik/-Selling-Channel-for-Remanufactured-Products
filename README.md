Research Topic on Selling Channels

This research explores the intersection of remanufacturing, sustainability, and channel optimization. We developed an analytical model to study how manufacturers choose between direct, reseller, and platform-based channels for selling remanufactured products under various policy regulations.
The work applies game-theoretic modeling and optimization techniques to analyze profit functions, equilibrium strategies, and the impact of environmental regulations on channel performance.
The paper is set to be published soon, highlighting insights for sustainable operations and supply chain policy design.
